# Spotify playback gap analysis
 ***By Youssef ZEROUAL***

This analysis aims to delve into Spotify listening habits by focusing on the **gaps between playback events**. The purpose is to quantify and understand listening consistency and engagement frequency at different levels, including per song, per artist, and per genre. Lower gap values indicate more frequent or habitual listening, while higher values suggest sporadic engagement.

The dataset used for this analysis is the result of a **previous Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**. This prior EDA involved comprehensive data cleaning, preprocessing, and initial feature engineering, drawing from Spotify listening history and a list of liked songs to create a merged dataset (`df_merged`). Short or skipped tracks (those less than 30 seconds) were excluded during this initial process to improve data quality and relevance.

In **this analysis**, we perform **further aggregations and feature engineering** specifically to suit the purposes of gap analysis. The core data used is aggregated into key DataFrames such as `unique_days_by_song`, `unique_days_by_artist`, and `unique_days_by_genre`, which capture playback history and derived time-based metrics.

The core methodology involves engineering new features to quantify listening behavior over time, specifically focusing on **playback gap metrics**. These include `day_gaps` (a dictionary of gaps in days between consecutive listening events), `day_gaps_mean` (the average gap), and `day_gaps_mean_over_day_count` (the average gap normalized by the total playback count). These metrics are computed for songs, artists, and genres. The lifespan of a song, artist, or genre, calculated as the time difference between the first and last playback timestamp, is also computed and used in the analysis.

It's important to understand how "gaps" are defined in this analysis. The primary focus is on **relative playback gaps**, which means the time difference between consecutive days *on which a specific item (song, artist, or genre) was listened to*. When a song has a playback gap, it does not necessarily mean that there was no listening activity at all on that day in the overall dataset; other songs or multiple other songs might have been listened to on that specific day. Therefore, this analysis primarily examines gaps *within* the timeline of days that had at least some listening activity recorded in the dataset.

However, one section of the analysis, specifically the time series analysis, also examines **true gaps**, which are days that had **actually zero songs played** across the entire dataset. This is analyzed by creating a DataFrame (`global_gaps`) that considers every day within the full date range of the listening history and identifying whether each day was 'active' (had playbacks) or 'inactive' (had no playbacks). This allows for an understanding of global listening patterns and periods of inactivity.
### **Key Takeaways and Insights**  
The analysis revealed distinct patterns in listening consistency across different levels:  

*   **Global "True" Gaps (Overall Listening Rhythm):**  
    *   Examining days with zero playbacks showed significant variability in overall listening activity over time.  
    *   **Yearly patterns** indicated peak consistency in **2020 and 2024 (~80-81% active days)**, with **2021–2023 showing moderate engagement (58–72% active days)** but sustained playback hours, suggesting **longer sessions on active days**. The outlier is **2019**, with low active days (41%) but high total hours, implying **bursts of intense listening**.  
    *   **Monthly patterns** highlighted **August as the most active month (41% ratio) with the highest playback hours (235h)**, likely tied to summer routines. **Spring months (April–June)** had the lowest activity (24–27% active days) and moderate hours, suggesting fragmented listening.  
    *   **Weekly patterns** showed **Thursday and Tuesday as peak days** for both activity (60–61%) and playback hours (261–285h), while weekends were less dominant than previously observed, indicating **midweek focus for immersive listening**.  

*   **Relative Playback Gaps (Consistency per Item):**  
    *   Filtering the data for songs with at least 2 plays and a lifespan of 30+ days helped focus the relative gap analysis on more meaningful listening patterns, although this filtered out a significant portion (over 60%) of the original songs, largely single or very low play-count tracks.  
    *   The average gap between plays for a song in the filtered set was around 33 days, but the median was ~ 17 days, indicating that while some songs have very long gaps, many are revisited more frequently. The distribution was right-skewed, showing most songs have relatively short gaps but a long tail of infrequently revisited ones.  
    *   **Listening Lifespan** analysis showed that most songs have a relatively short lifespan (~ 2.2 years median, ~ 2.3 years mean), suggesting frequent music exploration, while a smaller subset spans much of the dataset's duration (~ 5.7 years max), indicating deeply embedded favorites.  

*   **Categorization by Gap Patterns & Longevity:**  
    *   **Core Songs (Dense Playback + Big Longevity):** Songs played frequently (avg gap < 1 day normalized) over a long period (lifespan >= 2 years). These tracks show high replay frequency, long-term relevance, and consistent inclusion in habits. Examples displayed different gap patterns: habitual daily use ("Beethoven"), emotional/contextual clusters ("C. Tangana"), and situational/episodic bursts ("Stars Of The Lid"). They span diverse genres and emotional ranges.  
    *   **Recent Obsessions (Dense Playback + Small Longevity):** Songs played frequently (avg gap normalized <= 0.5) but within a short period (lifespan <= 500 days). These are typically recent favorites from the last ~1.4 years, showing intense listening over a concentrated period. They often fall into world music and indie pop genres and have high valence but mixed energy, reflecting emotional or rhythmic appeal for specific contexts. The gap patterns show dense initial playback followed by slightly more spaced-out revisits or intermittent breaks.  
    *   **Sparse but Persistent Songs (Sparse Playback + Big Longevity):** Songs played infrequently (avg gap >= 1 day normalized) but over a long period (lifespan >= 3 years). These are "background staples" or "slow-burn favorites" that resurface occasionally across years. They represent a wide diversity of genres (classic rock, folk, world music, etc.) and emotional tones, often linked to contextual or emotional triggers, cultural ties, or recurring playlists. The individual gap patterns show long periods of absence punctuated by occasional listens or brief, dense returns.  
    *   **Frequent but Fleeting Songs (Sparse Playback + Small Longevity):** Songs played regularly (avg gap >= 1 day normalized) but only within a short overall lifespan (<1 year). This group represents "passive repetition" – tracks encountered repeatedly over a few months, likely via playlists, but not developing into obsessions or long-term favorites. They often reflect recent trends (Latin pop, indie pop, world music) and fulfill different mood-based roles temporarily.  

*   **Core Artists & Genres (Dense Playback + Big Longevity):**  
    *   Identifying **core artists** (frequently revisited over 3+ years) revealed names deeply integrated into listening habits, often tied to emotional, cultural, or creative routines. These artists spanned classical, Latin American folk, Italian traditional, and atmospheric indie genres, reflecting deep emotional and cultural roots and support for a wide emotional palette.  
    *   Identifying **core genres** (frequently revisited over 3+ years) reinforced the artist findings, showing classical (especially piano/chamber), indie folk/folk, post-rock/dream pop, and various cultural traditions (Italian, Tango, Gnawa, Polka) as deeply embedded categories. These genres serve as long-term companions for focus, reflection, emotional states, and cultural identity.
